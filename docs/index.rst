Introduction
============
**ARA** is a `Grasshopper <https://www.rhino3d.com/features/#grasshopper>`_ plugin that augments the design process with data-driven and inverse design approach
by leveraging parametric models built in Grasshopper with generative AI models.
It enables architects, engineers and designers to efficiently generate design solutions with the assistance of generative neural networks.
The inverse design paradigm accelerates design exploration by providing many different design variants that match requested objectives.

With **ARA**, you can easily generate a project-specific the dataset and then train and deployy of a custom autoencoder model to generate designs.
**ARA** also comes with various visualization tools for data analysis and performance evaluation.

Grasshopper plugin **ARA** builds on top of the `AIXD: AI-eXtended Design <https://aixd.ethz.ch>`_ toolkit.
